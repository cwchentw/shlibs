# shlibs

Small but handy aliases and functions for sh-compatible shells.

## Warning

Currently, **shlibs** intends for personal use only. The content of shlibs may change without warning. Use it at your own risk.

## Why shlibs?

I usually write and test programs in a cloud IDE. Each time I spawn a new virtual host, I have to set some aliases and functions for the environment.
To reduce the burden of repeated setting, I wrote this script.

## Usage

Load *commons.sh* to activate it.

```
$ source path/to/shlibs/commons.sh
```
